Mission Critical Services (MCS) are characterized by stringent requirements due to the criticality of the mission being performed. MCS can rely on different types of services, which include voice communications, video, data flows from sensors, location devices, among others. Service Function Chaining (SFC) enables the delivery of end-to-end services with distinct functions that can have multiple dependencies and different security requirements.
